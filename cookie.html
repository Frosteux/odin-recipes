    <p class="description">A staple in comfort food. I've tried dozens of chocolate chip recipes, some to my delight, and others to a more disappointing end. 
    After much trial and error I have found <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/" target="_blank">THIS</a> to be by far my favorite recipe.
    They have found the perfect balance between chewy middle, and crisp bottom that makes the endorphin factories fire on all engines.</p>
    <h2 class="index-banner sub-banner">Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="ingredients-list">
            <ul>
                <li>280g all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>.5 tsp salt</li>
                <li>170g unsalted butter, melted then cooled</li>
                <li>150g brown sugar</li>
                <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg, 1 additional egg yolk</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>225g of your favorite chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <div>
    <h2 class="index-banner sub-banner">Steps</h2>
        <div class="ingredients-list">
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.</li>
                <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to <strong>325°F (163°C)</strong>. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. </li>
                <li>Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
                <li>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2 class="index-banner sub-banner">Important Tips!</h2>
        <div class="ingredients-list">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do not skip chilling the dough!</strong> If you do not complete this step you will end up with a disappointing separating cookie. Cool for a minimum of 2 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>When scooping, make the dough balls tall!</strong> This makes the cookie thicker and ends up giving the cookie a much better texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring your eggs to room temperature!</strong> This allows the ingredients to incorporate better while also helping give these cookies their texture.</li>
            </ul>
